News
======
* üó£Ô∏è **Oct 20, 2025:**
  I will participate in [the 16th Asia Pacific Physics Conference (APPC16)](https://appc16.scimeeting.cn/en/web/index/24735). It is my first time to present my [particle physics x QI paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03555) in such a big event.
* üó£Ô∏è **Sep 25, 2025:**
  I will give a [talk](https://indico.itp.ac.cn/event/349/contributions/1907/) about my [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03555) of QI at collider in the 2025 Beijing Particle Physics and Cosmology Symposium (BPCS 2025).
* üìù **July 8, 2025:**
  My first paper on particle physics x quantum information is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03555). We find that the entanglement in scattering generated by heavy field has universal features, see [Research](https://cmsou.github.io/research/) for more detail.
