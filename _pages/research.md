I work on the intersection between theoretical high energy physics, cosmology and quantum gravity ([hep-th](https://arxiv.org/list/hep-th/recent), [astro-ph.CO](https://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph.CO/recent) and [gr-qc](https://arxiv.org/list/gr-qc/recent)).

You can find my papers in [INSPIRE-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1512636) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YTBV9l4AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research is about $$\mathcal{L}=\sqrt{-g}\frac{M_p^2}{2}R$$
